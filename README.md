# FIZZ BUZZ GAME

## What is it?
It is a simple fizz buzz game written in Ruby.

### Rules:
1. Enter number
2. If number dividable by 3 returns Fizz!
3. If number divisible by 5 returns Buzz!
4. If number divisible by 3 and 5 returns FizzBuzz!
5. If none of the conditions above applies returns number.

## How to run

### In development
1. run `bundle install`
2. run `bin/run`

### In "production"
1. run `docker build --tag fizz_buzz_game .`
2. run `docker run --rm -it fizz_buzz_game`

## What's next?
I'm planning to use this repo for saving my solutions of different
Leetcode/Codewars tasks and testing new features that I'm not used before.
